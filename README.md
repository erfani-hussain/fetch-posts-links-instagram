# This is a BETA version, if u think u can debug, don't hesitate
# It Fetches all the Posts Links from Instagram

# 1st step:
I do prefer to upgrade the pip version to the latest one
1. if u're on Windows:
> python -m pip install --upgrade pip
2. if u're on Linux(Debian):
> sudo python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# 2nd step:
You have to install 'instaloader' library, if u haven't already
1. if u're on Windows:
> pip install instaloader
2. if u're on Linux(Debian):
> sudo apt install instaloader

# 3rd step:
We're good to go, 
u can run the main.py file in ur terminal or CMD
1. if u're on Windows:
> py main.py
2. if u're on Linux(Debian):
> python3 main.py

# 4th step:
It'll ask u the instagram ID, put it without '@' symbol
e.g. we go with this account that has over 3K posts:
* ID: davidbombal
* Posts: Over 3k

after a few seconds, It'll create a text file containing all the posts links


* BTW: Do Not Trust Anything
